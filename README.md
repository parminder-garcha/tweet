# tweet

Personal pet project showing how to use OpenAI for a little bit of tweet analysis. 
Will demonstrate the 3 components involved (eventually) :- 

1) Download twitter tweets (based on public posting, can be any topic). 
2) Process the tweets by interacting with database (postgres). 
3) Use OpenAI features to interact with database to analyse the sentiments of the tweets.
